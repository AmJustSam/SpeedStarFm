    <h1>Tips For moving</h1>

       <h4>Take Notes</h4>

       <p>Make a note of your shipment registration number and keep it with you in case you need to call your mover with questions about your shipment.</p> <br>

       <h4>Get the Bed Ready</h4>

       <p>Designate one drawer of a dresser for sheets and towels so that you won’t have to rummage through boxes for these essentials the first night in your new home.</p><br>

        <h4>Don’t forget about the Fridge</h4>

       <p>After you’ve thoroughly cleaned and dried the inside of your refrigerator, put a handful of fresh coffee, baking soda or charcoal in a sock or nylon stocking and place it inside to keep the interior smelling fresh.</p><br>

       <h4>Keep the Phone Book</h4>

       <p>Take your current phone book with you. You may need to make calls to residents or businesses back in your former hometown.</p><br>

       <h4>Pack Heavy – Pack Light</h4>

       <p>Pack heavy items in small boxes and lighter items in larger boxes.</p><br>

       <h4>Give out your Number</h4>

       <p>Before the van foreman leaves for your destination residence, give him a phone number where you can be reached. It is also a good idea to provide him with an alternate contact in case you can’t be reached.</p><br>

       <h4>Protect Your Memories</h4>

       <p>If it’s irreplaceable, take it with you in the car (you don’t want regrets later). But if you do decide to pack framed photos or art, place sheets or blankets between them for added protection.</p><br>

       <h4>Know how to Pack Plates and Records</h4>

       <p>Plates and record albums should be packed on end vertically, rather than placed flat and stacked.</p><br>

       <h4>Remember the Bare Necessities</h4>

       <p>Toilet paper, telephone, toiletries, snacks, coffee (and pot), soap, flashlight, screwdriver, pliers, can opener, paper plates, cups, utensils, a couple of pans, paper towels, and cleaning supplies are some of the essentials you may need upon arrival at your new home. Pack a box with these types of items and ask your van foreman to load it last so that it will be unloaded first.</p><br>

       <h4>Unscrew Bulbs</h4>

       <p>Remove bulbs before packing your lamps.</p><br>

       <h4>Tag your Items</h4>

       <p>For your garage sale, tag all items and be prepared to wheel and deal. Garage sale gurus love to haggle.</p><br>

       <h4>Give the Kids an Exercise</h4>

       <p>Have children write their names and new address on the cartons from their rooms so they can become familiar with their new street and town.</p><br>

       <h4>Help your Pet Relax</h4>

       <p>Keep your pet calm and away from all the activity on moving day by arranging for a friend to watch him at their house.</p><br>

       <h4>Be Nice to Your Plants</h4>

       <p>When moving plants to your new residence via your car, try not to let foliage rest against the windows, as the leaves will scorch.</p><br>

       <h4>Take a Break from the Computer</h4>

       <p>Upon arrival at your new home, let your computer “acclimate” itself to room temperature before plugging it in.</p><br>

       <h4>Enjoy the Help</h4>

       <p>Leave the rest to the professionals, sit back and relax, and look forward to the new opportunities, friends and experiences that are part of any move. Be sure to get a good night’s rest before the pickup and delivery days!</p><br>

       <h1>Tips</h1>

        <h3>FAQ:</h3>

        <h4>When should I contact Yasin Movers to organize my local &amp; International move?</h4>

        </p>Advance preparation is the most important factor in a successful move. You should approach WRAP IT to carry out your move 6-8 weeks before your intended moving date. This will allow enough time for Yasin Movers to work into your quotation, make all the arrangements and organize your move.</p><br>

        <h4>How do I determine the level of protection that is required for my belongings in an international move?</h4>

        </p>In general, you should think about what it would cost to replace your household goods and personal effects in the country of destination. A good source of information will be the local press in that country especially with regard to high value items like motor vehicles etc. When completing your proposal form please be as detailed as possible. Remember to include specific individual items that have a high replacement cost. It’s best to give as much information as possible.</p><br>

        <h4>How much notice must I give to book a date for packing?</h4>

        <p>Yasin Movers is very flexible on time. We are just a call away from you and we will ensure that your deadline will be met.</p><br>

        <h4>What advice can you give me on how to plan for my international move?</h4>

        <p>There is no substitute for planning and preparation. As soon as you know that you’re going to be moving overseas, contact Yasin Movers. In addition, begin to think about separating out all the items that you’ll need to sell, store, dispose of, give away, and those you’ll want to move by sea, have sent by air cargo or delivered to another family member before your departure. It’s a very good idea to have researched these categories before our estimator visits you to survey your household effects.</p><br>
